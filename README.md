Repository containing all python code produced so far in my PhD project

### Ku_snow:
  All code written for the production of the "Spurious variability in satellite altimeter-derived sea ice thickness" paper so far.
  ‘dataframes’ folder contains:
  - daily mean
  - 30-day running means
  - unsmoothed anomalies (daily mean - 30-day running mean)
  - smoothed anomalies ( 9-day running mean of unsmoothed anomalies)
  for the CS2_CPOM, CS2_LARM, CS2S3_CPOM, CS2S3_LARM, SM-LG snow depth, ERA5 wind speed and ERA5 air temperature datasets. 

### AK_IS2_snow:
  Preliminary results reproducing Ku_snow analysis for AltiKa and IS2 
  
### SIT_snow_inversion:
  Preliminary results for inverting snow depth and sea ice thickness using the interpolated radar freeboards
  
### testing:
  Test codes produced at the start of my PhD to familiarise myself with python, try to reproduce figures from Gregory et al. (2021) and preliminary results showing the correlation between freeboard estimates and ERA5 snowfall.
